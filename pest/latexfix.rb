# It's impossible or at least very hard to tell LaTeX to correctly
# indent the YAML file with spaces. Therefore, the indentation is done
# using leading 'u's instead. This script replaces those with normal
# spaces so it can be parsed as YAML file.
#
# The same can be said about YAML comments which are identified by a
# leading '#'. Those are expressed by a capital 'U'.
