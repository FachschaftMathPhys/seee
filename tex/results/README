Order of inclusion
==================

These files are loaded when evaluating a semester (i.e. rake pdf:semester).
Some handling is done in lib/result_tools.rb. The order of inclusion is
determined by each of the modelsâ€™ evaluate method, starting with
web/app/models/semester.rb. It currently looks something like this:

preamble
header
preface

For each course:
  
FIXME


Naming scheme
=============

Files named single_*.tex.erb define a visualization for single choice
questions. Similarily, multi_*.tex.erb provide visualizations for
multiple choice questions.

Files named *.def.tex include definitions (e.g. \newcommand) that do
not change, but do not fit in the preamble for one reason or another.
If a .def.tex provides special commands for a specific file it
should be named accordingly and all commands should be prepended with
the file name to avoid collisions. Since the underscore has a special
meaning in TeX, use CamelCase instead.
For example: single_histogram.tex.erb is included and executed for
each question with that visualizer. The corresponding definitions file is
called single_histogram.def.tex and all commands defined in it start
with \singleHistogram (e.g. \singleHistogramHist).
