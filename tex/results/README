These files are loaded when evaluating a semester (i.e. rake pdf:semester).
Some handling is done in lib/result_tools.rb. The order of inclusion is
determined by each of the modelsâ€™ evaluate method, starting with
web/app/models/semester.rb. It currently looks something like this:

preamble
header
preface

For each course:
  
FIXME
