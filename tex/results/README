Order of inclusion
==================

These files are loaded when evaluating a term (i.e. rake results:pdf_report).
Some handling is done in lib/result_tools.rb. The order of inclusion is
determined by each of the models’ evaluate method, starting with
web/app/models/semester.rb. It currently looks something like this:

preamble
header
preface
  questions for each course (repeat_for = course)
    questions for each lecturer (repeat_for = lecturer)
    questions for each tutor (repeat_for = tutor)

Where questions:
  single_*, multi_*, comment_*, both_too_few_answers

All of them may use small_header.tex.erb to add headlines.


For each course:
It groups questions by sections as defined in the form, but may insert
additional headlines in case the “repeat_for” value switches between
those sections.
Depending on repeat_for’s value, it will either evaluate a block of
questions for the course, course_prof or tutor. The “course“ blocks are
only printed once, for the course; “course_prof” and “tutor” blocks will
be included once for each lecturer or tutor.

Each question may have an arbitrary number of visualizers. If none is
defined, it will default to “*_empty”, but a warning will be given in
the web interface. See “naming scheme“ to see how visualizers should be
named.


Naming scheme
=============

Files named single_*.tex.erb define a visualization for single choice
questions. Similarily, multi_*.tex.erb provide visualizations for
multiple choice questions and comment_* will print the comments.

Files named *.def.tex include definitions (e.g. \newcommand) that do
not change, but do not fit in the preamble for one reason or another.
If a .def.tex provides special commands for a specific file it
should be named accordingly and all commands should be prepended with
the file name to avoid collisions. Since the underscore has a special
meaning in TeX, use CamelCase instead.
For example: single_histogram.tex.erb is included and executed for
each question with that visualizer. The corresponding definitions file
is called single_histogram.def.tex and all commands defined in it start
with \singleHistogram (e.g. \singleHistogramHist).

„Special“ files
===============

Some files may require further explanation:

both_too_few_answers.tex.erb:
  This file will be included whenever there are not enough sheets to
  include them without sacrificing the participant’s anonymity. The
  normal visualizations are skipped.

single_tutor_overview.tex.erb:
  Special view, that only works iff the question type is tutor_table.
  Will print an overview table that states how many sheets for a given
  tutor have been returned and on which page to find his or her results.
  The required TeX-labels are included in web/app/models/tutor.rb,
  regardless if you actually use this visualizer.

small_header.tex.erb:
  Adds a sub heading into the document, which may be used to separate
  sections, tutors, lecturers and the like. If the same headline is
  included more than once in a row, the 2nd and following headline will
  automatically be skipped. In other words, groups with the same
  headline will be merged.

variables_out_of_scope_err.def.tex
  Please see the documentation in lib/result_tools.rb, method
  include_form_variables.
