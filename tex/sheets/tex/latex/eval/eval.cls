% allows up to six possible answers. Arguments are as follows:
% \quest
% <(single|multi) (noanswer)> All arguments are optional. noanswer will add a now answer box to
%  (printAnswers|hideAnswers) at the end. Single/multi make the question single/multi choice.
%                             Use hideAnswers if you want to print them in a special header. This
%                             is useful if you have a large block that share the same answers.
%                             hideAnswers and \moreAnswers are incompatible and will likely lead
%                             to space issues (combining them makes no sense anyway)
