This is G'n'T Eval 1.1

1.1:
  • Performance: many performance improvements for the FormEditor
  • Performance: per course result PDF generation is now faster
  • Feature: add finish time estimate to many  long running jobs
  • Feature: collision detection may now store username
  • Feature: improve handling for multiple 3+ pages sheets. Still needs
             a lot of work, though.
  • Feature: emergency printing QR-code on the cover sheets for each
             course. The link is not available from within the web GUI
             unless you know it. Should make printing additional sheets
             easier for non-admins/non-organization personel.
  • Feature: some pages are now easier usable on a mobile phone (curr-
             ently only a few, mainly for emergency printing)
  • Feature: save which types of mail have been sent per course
  • Feature: docs on “interactive exploring” and sending mass mails
  • Feature: Hitme is map-reduce with humans, makes typing the hand-
             written comments easier and scales better with more people.
  • Bugfix: greatly improve OMR. It should now require much less user
            interaction / manual correction.
  • Bugfix: OMR would fail if there were missing corners
  • Bugfix: support multiple “evaluated by”s in GUI
  • Bugfix: comment field would cut off long comment images
  • Bugfix: sheet printing failed if the course title had certain chars
  • Bugfix: Ace editor looking weird in Chrome
  • Bugfix: inserting comments into the web GUI would fail if they still
            needed to be processed by a human (i.e. when OMR failed)
  • Change: using \underline in TeX now results in an error. Underline
            is ugly and should not be used in professional documents.
  • Change: single tutor eval now includes preface as well
  • Change: Semester is now called Term throughout the code
  • Change: Form table names are now automatically generated from form
            name and term title. This allows to simply copy the previous
            forms to the current term and be done with it. Please note
            that name collisions ARE POSSIBLE, because non-alpha-numeric
            chars are replaced. Collisions are not handlded.

1.0.2:
  • Bugfix: Various fixes for the FormEditor
  • Bugfix: Export-Stats-File was missing columns
  • Bugfix: Loading the stack for external apps required a DB
            connection due to including the Session-Classes
  • Bugfix: Questionnaires wouldn’t page break in certain locations
  • Feature: also export to XLSX if Gnumeric is installed
  • Feature: add many sanity checkers for Forms/Questionnaires

1.0.1: Fix small error in docs

1.0: It marks the first public release, that is
     deemed ready for other people to use.
