This guide shows how to run tests for G'n'T-Eval and where to add them.
Please note that as of writing tests are pretty scarce in the project,
so please do add them.


Rails / web gui / seee
----------------------

These tests are located in web/test and follow the common Rails way for
tests. You can run all tests by
  cd web/test && rake test
or if you want to run more specific files try something like
  cd web/test && ruby -I. functional/hitmes_controller_test.rb

For further information, have a look at the official Rails guide on that
matter: http://guides.rubyonrails.org/testing.html
