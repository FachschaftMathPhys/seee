If you want to run the Rails part of GnT Eval in production mode,
you need to call the following to set everything up:

  # first, remove all cached files and restore revisioned ones in
  # case they got deleted:
  cd web/public
  rm -r assets
  find . -name "*.html" -exec rm {} \;
  git checkout .
  
  # Now compile CSS and JS files:
  cd ..
  bundle exec rake assets:precompile
  
  # and finally start the server with:
  RAILS_ENV=production rails server


Your server should now be up and running and available at
  http://localhost:3000
  
  

If you want to serve it via Apache or Nginx you’ll probably need
RVM and Phusion Passenger. The RVM part is largely covered in the
INSTALL file, so have a look there first to avoid choosing the
wrong Ruby version and the like.

Installing Passenger is covered in [1,2] for Apache and nginx and
GnT Eval should be mostly set up for this. If there are other
projects on your server that won’t work with the Ruby version
required by GnT Eval, you need to fiddle a bit more, but there’s
documentation in [3-5]. If you’re capable of German there’s also
a nice summary on how to do this for Debian systems in [6].

Be aware that Rails.root is actually in the web/ subfolder. Thus
if you checked out the repository into /var/www-gnt-eval your
DocumentRoot would be /var/www-gnt-eval/web/public/.
