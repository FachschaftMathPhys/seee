G'n'T-Eval Virtual Box Image
============================

This image is meant for you to try out G'n'T-Eval before having to do
any real setup work. The webserver is forwarded by default, so you can
simply point your webbrowser to
  http://localhost:3000
to view the web GUI. Of course, you can use the one in the VirtualBox,
too.


You can download the image at:
http://b.uni-hd.de/gnt-eval/virtualboximg.html


All passwords, the user account, the hostname and everything else is set
to “gnt-eval”.


It’s recommended to use VirtualBox folder sharing feature if you want
to actually process scanned sheets from within the VBox. You can read
more about that here:
http://www.virtualbox.org/manual/ch04.html#sharedfolders


To update the image to the latest version of GnT-Eval you can simply
open a terminal and run
  cd ~/gnt-eval && git pull
to retrieve the newest stable release. You’ll have to restart the server
or simply reboot the virtual machine after that.



== Changes to default Debian Install

* Passwordless sudo via visudo command:
  ---------------
  gnt-eval ALL =(ALL) NOPASSWD : ALL
  ---------------

* Using http.debian.net mirror in /etc/apt/sources.list so it chooses
  the nearest mirror automatically

* Deactivated screensaver and screenlocker in Applications → System Tools
    → Preferences → System Settings → Brightness and Lock

* Added the Rails Server for the Web Gui to Startup Applications in
  Applications → System Tools → Startup Applications using
  ---------------
  gnome-terminal -e "bash -c 'cd /home/gnt-eval && source .rvm/scripts/rvm && cd gnt-eval/web && rails server || sleep 900'"
  ---------------

* Similar for the webbrowser:
  ---------------
  bash -c "sleep 30 && x-www-browser http://localhost:3000"
  ---------------

* Removed unnecessary software to make the image smaller

* Disabled Swap

* Installed oh-my-zsh


== Settings in VirtualBox

* Port 3000 is forwarded, so that the web GUI may be accessed from
  outside the VM. The command required to set this up is:
  ---------------
  VBoxManage modifyvm "GnT-Eval" --natpf1 "RailsForward,tcp,,3000,,3000"
  ---------------

* 1 GB of RAM is recommended
