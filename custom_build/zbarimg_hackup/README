This is the source of zbar[1] with a hacked zbarimg that suits our needs.
No other parts of the code have been touched, so it really looks ugly and
it requires a ton of dependencies to build. 

The commands/files of interest are:
make -- also builds the hackup
/zbarimg/zbarimg.c -- the source code
/zbarimg/.libs/zbarimg -- the executable without that bash crap

Note that you can easily build ZBarimg using 'rake magick:buildZBar' in
the seee-root directory.

Intended usage is as follows:
	zbarimg <imagefile>
It will print the found barcode to STDOUT, the image will be rotated
and flipped as required IN PLACE. If no barcode can be found, an
error code unequal to 0 will be returned.
