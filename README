G'n'T Eval
==========

G'n'T Eval is an evaluation suite that allows to carry out pen and paper 
evaluations. It ships with all necessary tools, i.e. management tools, form 
creation and printing as well as scanning and creating aggregated results.

Basically it works like this:

The tool is tailored towards university style teaching, i.e. professors giving 
lectures, tutors holding study groups for that lecture and students attending 
both.

Trying it out
-------------

If you want to try the software it is recommended to download a VirtualBox Image that has G'n'T Eval preinstalled. It works out of the box and you can simply point your web browser (not the VirtualBox one) to [http://localhost:3000] after starting the image. 
More information may be found in doc/VIRTUAL_BOX_IMAGE

The installation will take a while due to the large number of dependencies required. If you want to carry it out, you can find details in doc/INSTALL.
